# I-Wonder
I Wonder:
A game based on a delusional story written by Ayush. This visual novel is based on a fictional story and the characters are created in order to match the story. The sprites(characters) used in this game are taken from online sources and none of them belongs to me.

Context of the story: A person named kenzo, sitting in a restaurant gets lost in someone's thought. A person he knew from his past, but who? Discover it and enjoy the game.

The game's story is written inside script.rpy file and is in RenPy language. RenPy is a modified version of python and is used to create visual novels like this one. The code is self explanatory and I've uploaded everything that are used in the game, images, music, video, etc.
